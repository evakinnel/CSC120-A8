- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

My class is a guy (I've only created one so far, but there could be many chracters) who goes around and picks up trash. I picture him on a vacant beach. He has some fun abilities beyond the capabilities of most trash collectors (like flying, growing, and shrinking). He is mostly doing this in order to help the environment, but also because some things that have been left behind are useful, and he loves to recycle. 
Mostly the class does very simple versions of everything (prints statements and lets you know what a certain action accomplished), but there are a few building blocks and ideas laid out for how it can grow.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I implemented reconsider(item) because I wanted to do an undo()-like action, but I wanted to take in a parameter. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I was unable to import another class into my main one, even though I copied exactly how we imported the OneCard from the example a few weeks ago. That frustrated me for a while, and I couldn't find any answers on the internet, so I just changed around how I was doing it, and I actually think it all ended up making more sense. 
I did want to spend more time making things a bit more intricate, but I do think I got a good understanding of what the methods needed, and I could imagnine pretty clearly how I would implement something more exciting (and that's what the final project is for anyway!).
